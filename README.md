##Pirate Bartender Project
*bartending.py: contains two functions: take_order and make_order. 
*The function take_order ask questions to determine what kinds of kind the customer like. More specific, the function should ask each of the questions in the questions dictionary, and gather the responses in a new dictionary. The new dictionary should contain the type of ingredient (for example "salty", or "sweet"), mapped to a Boolean value. If the customer answers y or yes to the question then the value should be True, otherwise the value should be False. The function should return the new dictionary. 
*The function make_order determine the ingredients the drink has. More specific, the function should take the preferences dictionary created in the first function as a parameter. Inside the function you should create an empty list to represent the drink. For each type of ingredient which the customer said they liked you should append a corresponding ingredient from the ingredients dictionary to the drink. Finally the function should return the drink.
